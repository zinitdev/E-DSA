# Array

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Each element in an array is accessed by its index or position within the array. Arrays are commonly used in programming to organize and manipulate data efficiently.

## Advantages of arrays:

-   Quick access to array elements with constant time access, `O(1)`.

-   Easy storage and access of data of the same data type.

## Disadvantages of arrays:

-   The size of the array must be determined at compile time and cannot be changed afterwards.

-   Requires using multiple arrays if storing data of different data types.
